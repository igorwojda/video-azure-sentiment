### OpenTok Session ID & Token

To generate an OpenTok Session ID & Token, log into your [TokBox Account], and either create
a new project or use an existing project. Then go to your project page and scroll down to the
**Project Tools** section. From there, you can generate a session ID and token manually. Use the
projectâ€™s API key along with the session ID and token you generated.

**Important notes:**

- You can continue to get the session ID and token values from your Account during testing and
  development, but before you go into production you must set up a server. To learn more,
  visit [OpenTok Basics](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/basics/) in the Developer Documentation.
